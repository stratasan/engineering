# Growth

Growth in our careers is directly proportional to the scale of problems
we can effectively solve. To grow, we must advocate for ever-larger problems
and continually learn how to approach and solve them.

Stratasan has a high level of commitment to support our employees' ongoing
education and career growth. However, actually making use of this is our own
individual responsibility. This may include spending personal time on learning
new tools and processes outside of our normal working hours.

An implication of this is that over time, an individual should be able to close
similarly sized issues more quickly and/or complete larger issues in the same
time. Of course it's difficult to directly compare any two issues but we're
talking in the ideal sense here.

Julia Evans [has a great post](https://jvns.ca/blog/2018/09/01/learning-skills-you-can-practice/)
about the process of learning. Stratasan values the ability to learn,
i.e. the trajectory of growth, rather than the body of knowledge. Given how
quickly our industry moves, a penchant for learning is more valuable than knowing
a set of facts, some or all of which may be wrong, outdated, or just not useful
in the future.
