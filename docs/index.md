# Hello!

This Engineering Manual serves as a repository of Stratasan's Engineering culture. Our technical docs can be found in Confluence.

## Why document culture?

* By explicitly stating our goals, values and beliefs, our team will better work together and ultimately ship more valuable software.
* This document should help new team members understand how we work and make decisions.
* All team members can contribute to this version-controlled document in the same way everyone contributes to our software.

## Why is this project public?

Hopefully this document can give other teams a starting point for documenting their own culture. We are not, however, looking for pull-requests from non-team members :)
