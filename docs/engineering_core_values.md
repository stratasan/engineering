# Engineering Core Values

Our engineering team values are a subset of our company's core values, but they have their own distinct flavor.

## Code is our craft

- Dedicated learning
- We follow the "Scout Rule", we strive to leave things better than we found them.
- Technical practices
    - refactoring
    - Test Driven Development (TDD)
    - automated testing (unit tests)
- Infrastructure as code
- Being a predominately Python shop, we are quite familiar
  with [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/). One of the tenets is _simple is better than
  complex_. This manifests itself in
  [boring stacks](http://www.expatsoftware.com/Articles/happiness-is-a-boring-stack.html) and by avoiding
  over-engineered solutions.
- **Better, not best** - We recognize software development can be rife with compromise and sometimes the "best practice"
  isn't the most helpful or may not exist. So we will ship code with the best information we have at the time.

## Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

We all understand that the best way to detect design problems is to get a feature in front of a user. We want to build
minimum marketable features that we can get in front of users fast, so we can immediately start getting their feedback.

We believe in shipping early and shipping often. What makes this approach possible is an automated test-first workflow
that feeds in to a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Values beyond code

There are things beyond code that we value:

- Everybody does backlog refinement
- Communication (why, intentions?)
- Documentation is a first-class citizen

## Embrace diversity

This extends beyond demographics, and into background and into lived experiences. As DeMarco and Lister point out
in [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=peopleware&index=blended&link_code=qs&sourceid=Mozilla-search&tag=wwwcanoniccom-20)
, a diverse team can send a "clear signal that it’s okay not to be a clone, okay not to fit into the corporate mold of a
Uniform Plastic Person."

Furthermore, diverse teams have been shown
to [improve quality](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292225798/does-diversity-on-research-team-improve-quality-of-science)
.

We’re stronger because of our customer-first culture and our inclusive work environment. We’re an equal opportunity
employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, color, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran, or disability status. We believe our differences truly make us
stronger.

## We're stronger together

No one person has all the skills needed for every task. In addition to working alone, we often work together often in a
style called [Mob Programming](https://mobprogramming.org).

## Servant leadership

Similar to the company value Everyone Makes the Coffee, we lead by example. We don't solely follow hierarchy or rank; we
believe everyone has leadership abilities, so we aim to empower each other and make sure each team member is positioned
to success.

## Have life outside work

We know that every team member has a life outside of work and strive to respect that. Occasionally, we may have tighter
deadlines, but we work hard to set realistic expectations and believe that our best performance is achieved when working
regular business hours.

## Give back

We encourage and value user group participation, open source contributions, mentoring other developers, and other forms
of knowledge-sharing.
