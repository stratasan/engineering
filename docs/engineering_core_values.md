# Engineering Core Values

Our engineering team values are a subset of our company's core values, and they have their own distinct flavor.

## Code is our craft

- We dedicate time to learning.
- We aim to follow the "Scout Rule" and strive to leave code and documentation better than we found them.
- Technical practices are important:
  - Refactoring
  - Test Driven Development (TDD)
  - Automated testing (unit tests)
- We believe in infrastructure as code.
- Being a predominately Python shop, we are familiar with [the Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020). One of the tenets is _simple is better than complex_. This manifests itself in [boring stacks](http://www.expatsoftware.com/Articles/happiness-is-a-boring-stack.html) and by avoiding over-engineered solutions.
- We recognize software development can be rife with compromise and sometimes the "best practice" isn't the most helpful or may not exist. So we will ship code with the best information we have at the time.

## Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD)

We all understand that the best way to detect design problems is to get a feature in front of a user. We want to build
minimum marketable features that we can get in front of users fast, so we can immediately start getting their feedback.

We believe in shipping early and shipping often. What makes this approach possible is an automated test-first workflow
that feeds in to a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## Embrace diversity

This extends beyond demographics, and into background and into lived experiences. As DeMarco and Lister points out
in [Peopleware](https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&field-keywords=peopleware&index=blended&link_code=qs&sourceid=Mozilla-search&tag=wwwcanoniccom-20)
, a diverse team can send a "clear signal that it’s okay not to be a clone, okay not to fit into the corporate mold of a
Uniform Plastic Person."

Furthermore, diverse teams have been shown
to [improve quality](http://www.npr.org/2014/03/21/292225798/does-diversity-on-research-team-improve-quality-of-science)
.

We’re stronger because of our customer-first culture and our inclusive work environment. We’re an equal opportunity
employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, religion, national origin, age,
sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, pregnancy, familial status (having children), disability status, veteran
status, or genetic information. We believe our differences truly make us stronger.

## We're stronger together

No one person has all the skills needed for every task. In addition to working alone, we often work together often in a
style called [Mob Programming](https://mobprogramming.org).

## Have life outside work

We know that every team member has a life outside of work and strive to respect that. Occasionally, we may have tighter
deadlines, but we work hard to set realistic expectations and believe that our best performance is achieved when working
regular business hours.

## Take breaks

With a job that is cognitively heavy, we support each other to take breaks when "hitting a wall". We also think that
rest and time away from work are important for recharging. Stratasan also provides the second Friday of each month as a
day to completely step away from work to recharge, rest, run errands, do something nice for yourself, etc. We call this
day "Second Fridays".

## Give back

We encourage and value user group participation, open source contributions, mentoring other developers, and other forms
of knowledge-sharing.
