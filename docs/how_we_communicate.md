# How We Communicate

## Slack
Most of our communication is over Slack. Given that we are a distributed team,
we work to communicate availability in a manner considerate to our teammates.

We also work to make sure that important decisions are well-documented. Chat is,
generally speaking, more ephemeral so most important developer conversations
should occur via email or GitHub comments.

### Slack Considerations

- We default Slack's do not disturb settings to be outside of work hours.
  Generally, if the need is urgent, we communicate via text messages.
- If we are going to be [away from keyboard
  (AFK)](http://www.internetslang.com/AFK-meaning-definition.asp) for more than
  10-15 minutes, we let others know by communicating how long we expect to be
  gone and how to reach us in an emergency.

## Meetings

We document any decisions that are made and actions that are required so that we
can share them with non-attendees.

## Work Hours

Our company's official business hours are from 8am-5pm. However, in order to
reduce the amount of time in traffic, some of our team shifts those hours around
(for example, 7am-4pm or even 9am-6pm). Team members should communicate their
availability with the rest of the company in order to alleviate any concerns
about scheduling.

## Working Remote

- The development team typically works remote once a week on Thursdays.
- Working remotely at other times is allowed with approval from your manager.
- On remote work days, we generally send a greeting and parting message in
  Slack. Emoji messages with a hand waving or sunrise also work. This is the
  equivalent of walking into the office in the morning - it helps us know when
  our teammates are online. We also let each other know when we're going to be
  away for lunch. See "away from keyboard" note above.
- When working remote, it is your responsibility to make sure that your meetings
  for the day do not require you to be physically present for them. If they do,
  you should not work remotely that day.
- When working remote, it is your responsibility to request call-in numbers
  and/or video conferencing links for meetings in advance whenever possible.
