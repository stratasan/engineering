# How We Communicate

- Add RFCs?

*As a general rule:*

- *Slack channels are for* messages for teams that do not require an immediate response, think 1-3 hours. (see
  our [Slack Usage Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1713dQdCn-3_UYn4GGd4aPwOtJTtx2mlRu1cx7cyh8/edit)
  for ways to manage Slack usage).
- *Texting a mobile device is for* messages that require a response as soon as possible (team members are strongly
  encouraged to keep their mobile number on their Slack profile).
- *Email is for* longer, cross-departmental conversations that should have a written, searchable record (e.g.,
  decisions, requests to access data).
- *Confluence* is our go-to for internally documenting processes to share with other engineering team members.
- *Video conferencing (Google Meets or Slack video calls) are for*
  real-time collaboration that requires high-bandwidth communication. It's also for staying well-connected to each
  other. Face-to-face communication is important to team cohesion.

## Slack

Most of our communication is over Slack. Given that we are a distributed team, we work to communicate availability in a
manner considerate to our teammates.

We also work to make sure that important decisions are well-documented. Chat is, generally speaking, more ephemeral so
most important developer conversations should occur via email or GitHub comments.

### Slack considerations

- We generally chat on public channels rather than private direct messages because conversations might have value to
  others or to our future selves (since we pay for Slack's history retention).
- We default Slack's do not disturb settings to be outside of work hours. Generally, if the need is urgent, we
  communicate via text messages.
- If we are going to be [away from keyboard
  (AFK)](http://www.internetslang.com/AFK-meaning-definition.asp) for more than 10-15 minutes, we let others know by
  communicating how long we expect to be gone and how to reach us in an emergency.

## Meetings

We document any decisions that are made and actions that are required so that we can share them with non-attendees.

## Work hours

Most Stratasan folks are based in the central time zone, with a growing number of people working from different times
zones. Our team is generally available from 8am-5pm CST. We have flexibility to shift those eight hours earlier or
later, like 7am-4pm or even 9am-6pm.

## Distributed team communication

As a fully distributed team, we work to communicate availability via Slack. We say hello when we come online and goodbye
when we head out for the day (usually on the #dev channel). Furthermore, we let our team know when we're going to step
away for an extended time, whether for lunch, going heads down on a project for a while, or other reasons. Also, members
should keep their calendars updated so others can know your availability in order to alleviate any concerns about
scheduling.
