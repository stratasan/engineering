# How We Communicate

## Slack

Most of our communication is over Slack. Given that we are a distributed team,
we work to communicate availability in a manner considerate to our teammates.

We also work to make sure that important decisions are well-documented. Chat is,
generally speaking, more ephemeral so most important developer conversations
should occur via email or GitHub comments.

*As a general rule:*

- Slack channels are for messages for teams that do not require an immediate
  response, think 1-3 hours. (see our [Slack Usage
  Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1713dQdCn-3_UYn4GGd4aPwOtJTtx2mlRu1cx7cyh8/edit)
  for ways to manage Slack usage).
- Texting a mobile device is for messages that require a response as soon as
  possible (team members are strongly encouraged to keep their mobile number
  on their Slack profile).
- Email is for longer, cross-departmental conversations that should have a
  written, searchable record (e.g., decisions, requests to access data).
- Google Documents are for documenting processes to share with other team
  members, particularly in other departments.
- GitHub is for discussions internal to the engineering (and sometimes product
  management) teams.
- Video conferencing (Google Hangouts or Slack video calls) are for
  real-time collaboration.

### Slack considerations

- We default Slack's do not disturb settings to be outside of work hours.
  Generally, if the need is urgent, we communicate via text messages.
- If we are going to be [away from keyboard
  (AFK)](http://www.internetslang.com/AFK-meaning-definition.asp) for more than
  10-15 minutes, we let others know by communicating how long we expect to be
  gone and how to reach us in an emergency.

## Meetings

We document any decisions that are made and actions that are required so that we
can share them with non-attendees.

## Work hours

Our company's official business hours are from 8am-5pm. However, in order to
reduce the amount of time in traffic, some of our team shifts those hours around
(for example, 7am-4pm or even 9am-6pm). Team members should communicate their
availability with the rest of the company in order to alleviate any concerns
about scheduling.

## Distributed teams

- As a partially-distributed team we work to communicate availability via Slack.
  For example, we say hello when we come online and goodbye when we head out for
  the day (usually on #dev). Furthermore, we let our team know when we're going to
  step away for an extended time, whether for lunch, going heads down on a project
  for a while, or other reasons.
- The Nashville-located development team typically works remote once or twice a week.
- If you're in Nashville, it is your responsibility to make sure that your meetings
  for the day do not require you to be physically present for them. If they do,
  you should not work remotely that day.
- When working remote, it is your responsibility to request call-in numbers
  and/or video conferencing links for meetings in advance whenever possible.
- Make sure you are familiar with our [remote work policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eCmUvFDMOIAwf9nsTMLBPPlTZfWSu1GzQhPpS77hiM0/edit).
  This provides details on how to keep your devices and work environment secure.
