# Engineering Anti-Patterns

These are patterns we work to actively discourage and avoid.

## Hero worship

Senior developers are not infallible. Projects should not require long hours
from a hero that fixes everything at the last minute. All of our projects are
team efforts.

## Implicit knowledge

If it's not written down, it's a hidden dependency. Document it with an email
or, better yet, add it to our documentation.

## "Well, actually..."

Being pedantic or attempting to shame team members on technicalities is never a
good idea.
