# Engineering Anti-Patterns

Below are patterns we work to actively discourage and avoid.

## Hero worship

Senior developers are not infallible. Projects should not require long hours from a hero that fixes everything at the
last minute. All of our projects are team efforts.

## Knowledge silos

We try to avoid knowledge silos. We have a culture of writing things down to help empower others with information.

## "Well, actually..."

Being pedantic or attempting to shame team members on technicalities is never a good idea.
