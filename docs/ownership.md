# Ownership & Follow-Through

The most important thing we do is ship software. Authoring a large number of
in-flight (not-merged) Pull-Requests does not help our team or business so be
cognizant of when teammates review your PRs and appropriately respond to them.
On the flip side, be aware of requested reviews and when teammates have
responded to your reviews.

Taking an issue, epic, or product makes it your responsibility. Work to ensure
your changes correctly address the product need. This may include getting
feedback from product or users in a staging or beta environment.

Especially for externally-generated issues, follow-up via the product or CS
teams to tell them of the changes.
