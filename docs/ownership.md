# Follow-Through and Ownership

The most important thing we do is ship software. Authoring a large number of
in-flight (not-merged) pull requests does not help our team or business so
be cognizant of when teammates review your pull requests and appropriately respond to them.
On the flip side, be aware of requested reviews and when teammates have
responded to your reviews.

Taking an issue, epic, or product makes it your responsibility. Work to ensure
your changes correctly address the product need. This may include getting
feedback from product or users in a staging or beta environment.

Especially for externally-generated issues, follow-up via the Product or Customer Success teams to tell them of the changes.
