# Stratasan Core Values

## Everybody makes the coffee

We help where help is needed. Whether we’re asked to pitch in on an important customer call, run a meeting at the last-minute, or make the morning coffee -- everybody does what’s necessary to keep the engine running. We don’t believe in “pulling rank”.

## Our success is my success

We support one another, strive for the success of the team, and recognize nothing is done alone.

## We'll figure it out

We may not immediately have the answer to a question or solution to a problem, but we are always committed to finding one. We believe most challenges can become great opportunities - with a little brainstorming, thoughtful conversation, and a resourceful attitude. Whatever comes our way, _we'll figure it out_.


## We have trimmed the list of official values but the rest still ive in our hearts.
## Honest conversations make us stronger

The toughest conversations, when approached with kindness and respect, yield the best outcomes for the business and the team. We don’t hide from tough conversations.

## Seek first to understand

We try to see other people’s perspective prior to sharing ours. We make a deliberate effort to see things from their point of view and refrain from judgment until we do. This goes for interaction with customers, colleagues, and prospects alike.

## Assume positive intent

We believe it’s important to start from the assumption that people are good and that the intent behind their action is positive. We believe this builds stronger and more trusting relationships.

## Show up and don’t quit

Whatever we are doing at Stratasan, we must first consciously show up; and when things are difficult we must convince ourselves don’t quit.
