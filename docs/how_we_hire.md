# How We Hire

We strive to be transparent about our hiring process. While specifics may differ from posting to posting, this is our
general process.

1. We lint all of our job postings with [joblint.org](https://joblint.org).
1. We always provide a salary range in our postings so there are no surprises for anyone at any stage of the process.
1. After posting a job, we'll use social media to spread the opportunity to our network. We're also actively identifying
   ways to spread job posts beyond our network in an attempt to find candidates who wouldn't normally think about
   applying to Stratasan.
1. Based on the rate of responses, we keep job posting up for 2-4 weeks though perhaps longer.
1. If a candidate has time constraints outside of normal business hours, we'll work with them to find a good time to
   complete the interview process.
1. During this time, we'll conduct phone interviews with candidates meeting the minimal qualifications. This phone call
   is a behavioral interview and we'll ask questions that don't have right or wrong answers but are designed to get at
   the candidate's opinions and previous experience. Example questions might be "Describe your ideal deployment
   pipeline" or "Tell us about a time a release you were involved with didn't go to plan".
1. Based on these conversations, we'll work with a candidate to understand how they work. This serves to let us see how
   they approach problems and gives the candidates the opportunity to see the quality of our codebase and how we write
   issues.
1. Based on the previous steps, we'll determine candidates who we feel will be most successful at Stratasan and provide
   overviews of our benefits and discuss concrete compensation packages. At this point we'll ask for references and
   follow-up with those provided.
1. We'll extend offers upon agreement of compensation and reference checks.
