# Supporting our Systems

Part of the on-going contract of the Engineering Team to the company is
providing support for the application and data processing services we
provide. Our `@oncall` slack team is meant to make it explicit:

* How Customer Success can ask a question of developers
* What developers should pay attention to `#support`

This slack team is rotated weekly to balance specific development time
and the on-call rotation. Spending time in support is your best chance
to learn about things you might not know, but it *will* break apart
your day into small chunks. We've found with explicit on- and off-time,
we're better able to focus when not on support.

While on on-call, please do your best to:

* Respond to questions in #support tagged with `@oncall`
* Gather specifics data points (URL, expected behavior vs. actual behavior, etc)
* Understand what success looks like from Customer Success' angle. They're not
  always asking for new work, just an explanation as to the behavior.
* When digging into an issue, please provide timely updates and when CS can
  expect an update. If you need 30 minutes to understand the issue, say so _and
  follow-through_.
* It is OK to not understand a particular issue and say so but in this case
  work to bring in a colleague who can help. The information you've gathered
  in triaging the issue will help whomever you bring in.
* If a question does take significant time to answer, please add a `:fire_engine:`
  reaction so we can talk about it as a time in our next weekly meeting.
